```dart
// Connection pattern
final device = await FlutterBluePlus.startScan();
await device.connect();
final services = await device.discoverServices();

// Command sending
final command = hexStringToCmdBytes("0x0103...");
await characteristic.write(command);

// Notification handling
characteristic.setNotifyValue(true);
characteristic.value.listen((data) => parseNotification(data));
```

### 2. Python (ha-colmi-ble)
```python
# Async BLE pattern
async with BleakClient(address) as client:
    await client.start_notify(UUID, notification_handler)
    await client.write_gatt_char(UUID, command)
```

### 3. Go (RingCLI)
```go
// TinyGo Bluetooth
adapter := bluetooth.DefaultAdapter
device, _ := adapter.Connect(address)
service, _ := device.DiscoverServices([]bluetooth.UUID{serviceUUID})
char, _ := service.DiscoverCharacteristics([]bluetooth.UUID{charUUID})
char.WriteWithoutResponse(packet)
```

### 4. Swift (Halo)
```swift
// CoreBluetooth pattern
centralManager.connect(peripheral)
peripheral.discoverServices([serviceUUID])
peripheral.writeValue(data, for: characteristic, type: .withResponse)

### Emerging Features (Protocol Support but NO Current Hardware)
- **Blood glucose monitoring** - Protocol defines supportFlags3 bit 7 and DataType 9, but NO current models have glucose sensors. This is scaffolding for potential future hardware.
- **ECG monitoring** - Protocol defines DataType 7, but no ECG hardware exists in any current model
- **Temperature tracking** - Actually implemented in R06+ models with dedicated sensor
- Extended battery optimization
- Advanced sleep stage detection
- Workout type recognition

### Important Note on Blood Glucose
After thorough analysis of all repositories, firmware, and hardware specifications:
- **NO current COLMI ring models (R01-R10) support blood glucose monitoring**
- The hardware only includes: VC30F heart rate sensor, STK8321 accelerometer, and in R06+ models, additional SpO2/temperature sensors
- No glucose sensor hardware exists in any model
- Protocol support exists for future compatibility but is not functional
