### GOAL: 
integrate r-series ring into swift apps, this is just the framework to make easy wrapping into targets

### Requirements: 
- USE `direct XCFramework integration` : caveat i do have atleast two distribution apps needing this feature this repo is the feature to be cloned and used in those apps and the apps targets.
  - i do the same with Shenzen glasses 

### Resources:
None of this is new or not done before, and actually upon finds of github public repos well documented by the opensource community. [/Legacy](Legacy) includes several opensource examples and comprehensive COLMI ring implementations:
